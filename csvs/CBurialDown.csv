text," Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level.  Since CO2 stayed more or less constant over this time scale, so did temperature.","The decrease in buried carbon lowers one of atmospheric carbon's sinks.  Carbon sources (which remain constant in this scenario) exceed carbon removal, causing an increase.  It will take longer than 200 years to cause a level change though.","Volcanoes, mountain level, and weathering of buried carbon stay the same throughout this scenario.",,"Because temperature remained nearly constant, ice levels did to.","Because temperature (and ice level) remained fairly constant, so did sea level, weathering, and carbonate deposition.",,,,This scenario assumes carbon burial by sediments decreases.  It starts at a moderately high level (4).  It decreases to level 3 to start the process.,,
