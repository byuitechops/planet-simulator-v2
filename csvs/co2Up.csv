text,Temperature increases as the level of greenhouse effect increases.  Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level. ,Atmospheric CO2 increase is the forcer in this scenario.  CO2 increase results in a higher level of the greenhouse effect.,"Volcanoes, Mountains, and Isolation are not affected by a change in CO2. They are likely not to change over the 10 MY time scale of this simulation.",Likely remains unchanged,"Rising temperatures will melt ice, but response time is longer than 200 years","Rising temperature raises sea level quickly. Melting glacial ice and volcanic activity also raise sea level, but response times are longer.",Likely remains unchanged,"Rising temperature raises evaporation and precipitation, which increases weathering rates.","Rising weathering rates increase carbonate deposition, but response times are long (~100,000 years)","Rising precipitation transports and deposits more sediment, but carbon burial response times are long","Rising weathering rates can release buried carbon (if carbon-bearing rocks reside at the surface), but response times are long",
