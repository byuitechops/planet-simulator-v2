text," Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level.  Since CO2 stayed more or less constant over this time scale, so did temperature.","Volcanoes are adding more CO2 than the sinks are removing, thus Carbon sources exceed carbon sinks, causing an increase.  It will take longer than 200 years to cause a level change though.","This scenario begins in a ""snowball Earth"" state--Temperature, CO2, Ice, sea level, weathering, C burial by sediments, and buried carbon release by weathering are all at level 1.  Ice level is at 5.  Volcanoes, mountains, and insolation will stay constant at level 3 throughout the entire scenario.  The planet is NOT in equilibrium (unlike all of the other scenarios)--both sinks of C are virtually shut down as is one source (buried carbon release due to weathering), but volcanoes are still releasing CO2 into the atmosphere.","Volcanoes, mountain level, and insolation stay the same throughout this scenario.","Because temperature remained nearly constant, ice levels did to.  In addition, sea level, weathering, carbonate deposition, C burial by sedimentation, and buried C release due to weathering are all shut down in this time scale.  ","Because temperature (and ice level) remained fairly constant, so did sea level, weathering, and carbonate deposition.",,,,,,
