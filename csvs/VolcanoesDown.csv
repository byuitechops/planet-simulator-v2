text,Temperature decreases as the level of greenhouse effect decreases.  Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level. ,"Fewer volcanoes dump less CO2 into the atmosphere.  Because the carbon sinks take a long time to react (~100,000 years), CO2 sinks exceed CO2 sources, causing the atmospheric CO2 level to decrease.  However, it will take longer than 200 years for CO2 to change signficantly.  ","A decrease in volcanic activity is the forcer in this scenario, declining from level 4 to level 3 in 100-200 years to show that the process is underway.  This is much faster than a real volcano down scenario (they usually decline over several tens of millions of years).  ",,Dropping temperatures will cause ice accumulation.,"Deciling temperature lower sea level quickly, but in 200 years temperature has not changed much. Accumulating glacial ice and volcanic activity also lower sea level, but response times are longer.",,"Decreasing temperature lower evaporation and precipitation, which lower weathering rates.  However, it will take >200 years to respond.","Decreasing weathering rates lower carbonate deposition less C and Ca are washed to the oceans), but response times are long (~100,000 years)","C burial by sediments, buried C release, Insolation, and Mountains likely won't change enough to have an effect in this scenario.",,
