text,Temperature responds quickly to a change in CO2 level.,The drop in volcanoes lowers one of the CO2 sources.  Increases in buried C and carbonate deposition increase carbon sinks.  CO2 level decreases quite dramatically as a result.,"Volcanoes decreased, lowering one of the CO2 sources.",Mountains increased (one of the forcers),"Temp. decrease triggers polar ice accumulation, raising ice level.","A decrease in temperature drops sea level (thermal contraction).  Also, accumulation of polar ice removes water from the ocean, lowering sea level.",,"During the early part of this time scale, temperature was relatively high.  With more mountains, weathering increases.","More weathering increases the amount of C and Ca that washes to sea, raising carbonate deposition rate.  ","Increasing weathering rate inceases the amount of sediment delivered to the sea, increasing carbon burial.",,

text,Lower atmospheric CO2 results in lower temperature,"The drop in volcanoes decreases one of the CO2 sources; the sinks also decrease.  CO2 drops more, but more slowly as the sinks shut down.  ",Volcanoes stayed at level 2,Mountains increased to level 5,Lower temperatures trigger more polar ice accumulation.,"Polar ice accumulation lowers sea level.  Also, lower temperature and less volcanoes (less mid-ocean ridge activity) also lower sea level.",,"A decrease in temperature decreases rainfall, lowering weathering.  Increased mountains would increase weathering.  This time the lower rainfall wins out so weathering decreases.","Lowering weathering lowers the amount of C and Ca that washes to sea, lowering carbonate deposition rate.","Lower weathering rate decreases the amount of sediment delivered to the sea.  However, build up of glaciers add a rich source of sediments, increasing the sediment rate.  Increase in ice also limits bioproductivity at the coasts.  These effect cancel each other, leaving C burial by sedimentation unchanged from the 1 MY scale.",,
