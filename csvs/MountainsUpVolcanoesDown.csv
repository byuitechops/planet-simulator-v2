text,Lower atmospheric CO2 results in lower temperature,The drop in volcanoes decreases one of the CO2 sources; the rise of mountains increased at least 1 of CO2's sinks (could impact both).  CO2 drops as a result.,Volcanoes stayed at level 2,Mountains increased to level 5,Lower temperatures trigger more polar ice accumulation.,"Polar ice accumulation lowers sea level.  Also, lower temperature and less volcanoes (less mid-ocean ridge activity) also lower sea level.",,"A decrease in temperature decreases rainfall, lowering weathering.","Lowering weathering lowers the amount of C and Ca that washes to sea, lowering carbonate deposition rate.","Lower weathering rate decreases the amount of sediment delivered to the sea.  However, build up of glaciers add a rich source of sediments, increasing the sediment rate at this point.  ",,
