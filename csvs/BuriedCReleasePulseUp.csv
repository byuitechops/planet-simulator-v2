text, Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level.  ,"The increase in buried carbon release raises one of atmospheric carbon's sources significantly.  Carbon sources are now much higher than carbon removal, causing an increase in atmospheric CO2.  Atmospheric carbon build quickly, increasing to level 4 within 200 years.","Volcanoes, mountain level, and insolation stay the same throughout this scenario.",,"The large increase in temperature causes ice to melt.  It takes time for the ice to melt, so ice level only goes down by 1.","Sea level rises due to the melting polar ice.  The large surface temperature increase takes time to affect the entire ocean, so thermal expansion does not play a role in increasing sea level in this short time scale.  Since volcanoes remain constant, this effect plays no role in sea level change. ",,"The large temperature increase causes more evaporation, which causes higher rainfall, increasing weathering.","Higher weathering increases the amount of Ca and C washed to sea, increasing the amount of raw materials required to make carbonates.  However, this process has !100,000 year response time.  ",Higher weathering increases the amount of sediment available to bury organisms.  ,"This scenario assumes a short-lived but intense release of buried carbon.  Release of buried carbon lasts for ~1000 years, quickly ramping up from level 1 to 5 within a 200 year period.",

text,Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level.  ,"Over the 1000 year pulse, CO2 levels skyrocketed to level 5 (C sources were much higher then C sinks).  However, C sinks are now catching up and beginning to lower C.  It is still at level 5",,,"The large increase in temperature causes ice to melt.  By 100,000 years, all the polar ice is melted.","Sea level rises due to the melting polar ice.  Ocean temperatures have now become warmer, causing thermal expansion.  However, mid-ocean ridge activity remains constant.  Together, sea level rises, but not up to level 5. ",,"Because temperature is now at its highest level, the planet experiences extensive rains, increasing the weathering rate.","Higher weathering rate washes more Ca and C to sea,increasing carbonate deposition rate.  Both carbon sinks are now operating at high levels, but the carbon sources have decreased back to their initial levels.  CO2 level is very high but is rapidly decreasing.","Higher weathering means more sediment production that can bury more organic carbon.  By 100,000 years, carbon burial has increased to level 5.",This short-lived pulse is over within about 1000 years and drops back to level 1. ,

text,"Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level.  Because CO2 dropped, so did temperature.  However, due to loss of all polar ice, the planet's albedo is higher, helping to keep temperatures elevated (compared to the amount of atmospheric CO2).","C sinks have been removing C at a higher rate than C sources have been putting it in over this time scale.  As a result, atmospheric C has been decreasing, dropping from level 5 to level 3 over this time period.",,,"Temperature drop causes polar ice accumulation, raising the planet's ice level.  Since temperature remained at level 4, ice level is still low (level 2).","Because temperature dropped and ice level,  sea level dropped.",,"Because temperature dropped, the planet experiences less rain, decreasing the weathering rate.","Lower weathering rate washes less Ca and C to sea, decreasing carbonate deposition rate, decreasing the C sinks, although not enough to move system back to equilibrium (sinks are still removing C faster than sources are adding it).  ","Lower weathering rate means less sediment is being produced, decreasing C burial rate, and decreasing the C sinks. ",Buried carbon release stays at level 1 for the remainder of the scenario.,
