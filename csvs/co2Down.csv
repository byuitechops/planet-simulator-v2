text,Temperature decreases as the level of greenhouse effect decreases.  Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level. ,Atmospheric CO2 decrease is the forcer in this scenario.  CO2 decrease results in a lower level of the greenhouse effect.,"Volcanoes, Mountains, and Isolation are not affected by a change in CO2. They are likely not to change over the 10 MY time scale of this simulation.",,"Lower temperatures will cause ice to accumulate, but response time is longer than 200 years",,,"Lower temperature raises evaporation and precipitation, which decreases weathering rates.","Lowering weathering rates decrease carbonate deposition, but response times are long (~100,000 years)","Decreasing precipitation transports and deposits less sediment, but carbon burial response times are long",,
