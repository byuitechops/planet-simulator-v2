text,"  Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level.  Since CO2 remained constant, so did temperature.","In this short time scale, carbon sources and sinks are still in equilibrium, thus, atmopsheric CO2 level remains constant.","In this scenario, volcanoes, mountains, and insolation remain constannt.  Carbon burial by sedimentation and Buried Carbon Release due to weathering will likely not change enough to change levels.",,"Because temperatures remained constant, so did ice level.","Sea level changes due to changes in sea water temperature, volcanic activity (increased mid-ocean ridge activity), and ice level.  These all remained constant during this short time scale.",,"In this scenario, the weathering rate increases (for an unspecified reason).  In reality, several physical processes affect weathering rate (rainfall amount, amount of igneous rock exposed at the planet's surface, CO2 level, extent of glaciers, etc).  Although this is a long time scale process (certainly longer than 200 years), it is shown to indicate that the process is underway.","Increased weathering rates increase carbonate deposition (more C and Ca are washed to the oceans), but response times are long (~100,000 years)",,,

text,"  Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level.  Since CO2 level remained constant, so did temperature. ","Because of the high ice level carbonate deposition stabilized at level 4 (as explained there).  C sinks come into equilibrium with C sources, causing atmospheric CO2 levels to remain constant (although they probably fluctuated during this long time scale).",,,"Ice levels may rise to level 5 during this long interval, but returned to level 4 because temperatures remained at level 2 (again, due to the large amount of ice keeping the increased igneous rock from weathering).  ","Because of the high ice level, sea level remains low.  It probably dropped more during this long period but returned to level 2 as ice level is back at level 2 and temperature level is at level 2. ",,"Weathering continues to increase, reaching the highest level during this time scale.","Increased weathering rates increase carbonate deposition (more C and Ca are washed to the oceans).  This time scale is long compared to the Carbonate deposition time scale (~100,000 years).  The increase in carbonate deposition brings the system back into equilibruim during this time scale",,,
