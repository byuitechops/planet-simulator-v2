text,,None of the other parameters in the simulation change over 200 years.,,,,,"Insolation slowly rises as stars age.  It rises much more slowly than the timescales of this simulation will allow.  This scenario shows an insolation up scenario to show how the planet would respond.  Other insolation changes occur due to changes in Earth's orbit that occur at time scales to short to handle in the simulator.  In 200 years it won't move, but it is shown as rising to get the process started.",,,,,

text,"Because insolation rises, the planet's equilibrium temperature rises, so unless CO2 drops, the actual temperature will also rise.",CO2 remains constant (sources and sinks have not changed).,,,"As temperature increases, ice melts.  The ice-albedo feedback adds to the planet's rising temperature.","As temperature rises, water expands, occupying more volume.  Also, melting ice raises sea level.","insolation slowly rises, staying at a 3 for the entire 100,000 year time scale.","As temperature rises, weathering rises because there is more rainfall.",Carbonate deposition rises because higher weathering increases the amount of Ca and C available to make carbonates.,"Higher temperatures and melting ice cause a higher sedimentation rate.  However, this will probably not change much.","Carbon release by weathering may change slightly, but probably not by a level.",

text,Temperature continues to rise (although more slowly as carbonate deposition draws down CO2).,CO2 level decreases as C sinks exceed C sources.,,,All of the planet's polar ice melts as temperature warm.,Sea level is its highest  because all the polar ice is melted and temperatures are their warmest.,Insolation increases to its maximum level in the simulation (4).,"High temps mean high rainfall, maximizing weathering.",High weathering means high amounts of C and Ca to make carbonates from.  ,"High sedimentation rates mean a moderately high level of C burial.  Both C sinks have significantly increased.  C is being drawn out of the atmsphere.  Even with the higher insolation, the low C level will cause a decrease in temp, which shows up in the next time scale.",,

text,Temp decreases because of the decreasing greenhouse gas level.,"Because C sinks were larger than C sources in the last time scale, C level of the atmosphere drops to a very low level.  This cools the atmosphere even with the higher insolation.",,,A small amount of polar ice reappears as temperatures lower.,Sea level drops both because of the lower temperature (thermal expansion) and some polar ice.,Insolation remains at level 4,"Cooler temperatures decrease the amount of rainfall, decreasing weathering.",Carbonate deposition decreases because lower weathering decreases the amount of Ca and C available to make carbonates. Thus C sinks decrease to bring the C sources and sinks into equilibrium.,"Because sedimentation decreased, there is less organic carbon burial than in the last time step.  ",,
