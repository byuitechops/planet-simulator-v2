text," Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level.  Since CO2 remained constant, so did temperature.",CO2 level remains high because atmospheric CO2 sources and sinks have not changed from the initial state.,"In this scenario, insolation and volcanic activity remain constant.","Mountain building is a long time scale process (10-100 MY).  In 200 years mountains would not have changed levels.  However, you see an increase to show that the process is beginning.","Because temperatures remained constant, so did ice level.","Sea level changes due to changes in sea water temperature, volcanic activity (increased mid-ocean ridge activity), and ice level.  These all remained constant during this short time scale.","In this scenario, insolation will remain constant.",More mountains increases weathering rate (more igneous rocks are exposed to rainfall).  This would probably not change in 200 years.,"Increased weathering washes more Ca and C to the oceans, providing more raw materials to make carbonates.  However, the process rate has a ~100,000 year response time.","Increased mountains produce more sediments, increasing organic burial rates.  This will not have changed in 200 years though.",Increased mountains could increase buried carbon weathering.  This scenario assumes that the new mountains do not expose additional buried carbon.  ,

Carbon sources (buried carbon weathering and volcanic activity) have not changed).  As a result, atmospheric CO2 level decreases rather dramatically.",,The scenario assumes mountains build rapidly.  ,Decreasing temperature allows ice to begin to accumulate at the poles.,"Accumulating ice drops sea level.  In addition, decreasing temperature causes water to contract, lowering its volume.  Both effects cause sea level to drop.",,"More mountains increases weathering rate (more igneous rocks are exposed to rainfall).

text,"Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level.  Since CO2 dropped, so did temperature.","Carbon sinks reach their maximum levels at this time scale.  Carbon sources have not increased, so atmopheric CO2 levels continue to decreased.",,Mountains reach their highest extent and remain constant throughout the remainder of the scenario.,Decreasing temperature allows ice to begin to accumulate at the poles.,"Accumulating ice drops sea level.  In addition, decreasing temperature causes water to contract, lowering its volume.  Both effects cause sea level to drop.",,"More mountains increases weathering rate (more igneous rocks are exposed to rainfall).  This process is now at its maximum as mountains have reached their greatest extent, exposing the maximum amount of rock to weathering.  However, cooling temperatures slow down the hydrological cycle, lowering weathering.","Increased weathering washes more Ca and C to the oceans, providing more raw materials to make carbonates.  This process is fully operating in this time scale.",Sediment rate is maximum at this time.,,

text,"Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level.  Since CO2 remained constant, so did temperature.","Because C sinks come into equilibrium with C sources,  atmospheric CO2 levels remain constant (although they probably fluctuated during this long time scale).",,Mountains remain at level 5.,Constant temperatures caused ice level to also remain constant.,"Because ice level and temperature remained constant, sea level also remained constant.",,"Even though mountains remain very high, ice has built up and covers much of the planet (including many of the mountains). Also, dropping temperatures decreases the rainfall.  This decreases weathering and sedimentation rates.","Because weathering rate decreased, carbonate deposition rate also decreases.",Sediment rate decreased because much of the land is buried.  This also means that the total amount of organic carbon available to be buried decreased as well.  Both processes decrease the total amount of carbon burial.,,
