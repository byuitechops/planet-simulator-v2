text,,,"In this scenario, insolation, volcanic activity, and weathering of buried carbon remain constant.","Mountains down occurs as erosion eventually levels the landscape by weathering mountains and washing the sediments to the sea.  It is a long time scale process (100's of MY).  For example, the Appalacians are ~300-400 MY old.  In 200 years mountains would not have changed levels.  However, you see the change in level to show that the process is beginning.",,,,"Weathering, carbonate deposition, sedimentation, CO2, Temperature, ice and sea level would not change in this time period.",,,,

text," Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level.  Since CO2 rose, so did temperature.","Carbon sinks (carbonate deposition, Organic carbon burial by sediments) decrease, carbon sources remain constant, so atmospheric CO2 levels rise.",,,"Because temperatures rose, ice melted, so ice level dropped.","Sea level changes due to changes in sea water temperature, volcanic activity (increased mid-ocean ridge activity), and ice level.  Temperatures increased, raising sea level.  Likewise ice melted, returning water to the oceans.",,"Lower mountain level decreases the amount of rock exposed to weathering, decreasing the weathering rate.  ",Less weathering provides less Ca and C for the formation of carbonates.,"Sedimentation rate decreases as mountains become lower, decreasing the organic carbon burial rate.",,

text," Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level.  Since CO2 rose, so did temperature.","Carbon sinks (carbonate deposition, Organic carbon burial by sediments) stayed nearly constant, and carbon sources remain constant, so atmospheric CO2 levels leveled out (there is probably some change, but not enough to change the level).",,Mountains continue eroding away.,"Because temperatures stayed nearly constant, ice level stayed constant.","Because temperature stayed nearly constant, sea level also stayed nearly constant.",,"Loss of mountains decreases weathering.  However, warmer temperatures cause more rainfall and expose mountains buried under ice, increasing weathering.  These effects tend to cancel each other, helping to keep the weather rate relatively constant.  It probably changes, but not by a full level.","Because weathering rate didn't change much overall, carbonate deposition also remained nearly constant.","Because weathering rate didn't change much overall, buried organic carbon stayed nearly constant.",,

It is unlikely that C sinks and sources will come into equilibrium in this time scale.",,Mountains have eroded to a very low level.  ,"As temperatures rise, ice level continues to decrease as ice melts.",Sea level continues to rise temperature rises and ice melts.,,"Weathering has decreased significantly.  However, as temperatures rise, there is more rainfall, increasing rainfall and decreasing ice cover, keeping weathering from dropping to its lowest possible level.","Lower weathering decreases the amount of C and Ca that washes to the sea, decreasing the carbonate deposition rate.","Because there is very little sediment produced, there is little organic carbon burial.",,
