text," Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level.  Since CO2 stayed more or less constant over this time scale, so did temperature.","The increase in buried carbon raises one of atmospheric carbon's sinks.  Carbon sources (which remain constant in this scenario) are now lower than carbon removal, causing an decrease  It will take longer than 200 years to cause a level change though.","Volcanoes, mountain level, and weathering of buried carbon stay the same throughout this scenario.",,"Because temperature remained nearly constant, ice levels did to.","Because temperature (and ice level) remained fairly constant, so did sea level, weathering, and carbonate deposition.",,,,This scenario assumes carbon burial by sediments increses  It starts at a moderately low level (2).  It increases to level 3 to start the process.,,
