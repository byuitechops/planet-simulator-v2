text,Temperature increases as the level of greenhouse effect increases.  Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level. ,"More volcanoes dump more CO2 into the atmosphere.  Because the carbon sinks take a long time to react (~100,000 years), CO2 sources exceed CO2 sinks, causing the atmospheric CO2 level to rise.  It will take more than 200 years to change the level from 4 to 5 though.","An increase in volcanic activity is the forcer in this scenario.  We allow it to move from level 3 to level 4 in 100-200 years.  In almost all real cases, it will actually takea much longer time to change. ",,"Rising temperatures will melt ice, but response time is longer than 200 years","Rising temperature raises sea level quickly, but the temperature hasn't significantly changed in 200 years. Melting glacial ice and volcanic activity also raise sea level, but response times are longer.",,"Rising temperature raises evaporation and precipitation, which increases weathering rates, but temperatures haven't risen enough in 200 years to cause a significant change.","Rising weathering rates increase carbonate deposition (more C and Ca are washed to the oceans), but response times are long (~100,000 years)","C burial by sediments, buried C release, Insolation, and Mountains likely won't change enough to have an effect in this scenario.",,

text,Temperature increases as the level of greenhouse effect increases.  Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level. ,"In 100,000 years, CO2 levels have increased since the volcanic source has increased and the C sinks are just beginning to respond at this time scale.  Because CO2 started at a high level  (4), it reaches its maximum level (5) during this time scale.","An increase in volcanic activity is the forcer in this scenario.  It tops out at 5 by 100,000 years.  This is  a very rapid change in volcanism.   This level of volcanism will remain throughout the remainder of the simulation.",,"Rising temperatures will melt the planet's remaining ice in this 100,000 year period.","Rising temperature raises sea level quickly (due to thermal expansion). Melting glacial ice and volcanic activity (if due to higher mid-ocean ridge activity) also raise sea level, and will do so during this time scale.",,"Rising temperature raises evaporation and precipitation, which increases weathering rates.  However, since mountain levels are pretty low, there is not a lot of raw material to weather, so weathering rates rise by only 1 level.","Rising weathering rates increase carbonate deposition, which responses in ~100,000 years.",,,

text,"Temperature increases as the level of greenhouse effect increases.  Since CO2 level tops out and perhaps begins to slowly decline, temperature remains very high.  ","During this time interval, C removal (carbonate deposition) catches up and begins to surpass the increased volcanic source rate of CO2.  The CO2 level remains high, but begins to slowly decrease. ",,,"Because all the ice melted, the planet's albedo is as low as it can get.  As a result, the planet's temperature remains high, even when CO2 levels begin to slowly drop.","Sea level remains very high due to the high temperatures, high volcanic rate, and no polar ice.",,"Rising temperature raises evaporation and precipitation, which increases weathering rates.  Weathering rate tops out during this time scale.  If the planet had more mountains, weathering and carbonate deposition would have already restored balance between C sources and C sinks.",Weathering is now providing the maximum amount of raw materials to make carbonate (given the low level of mountains).  Carbonate deposition is now maximized.  ,,,
