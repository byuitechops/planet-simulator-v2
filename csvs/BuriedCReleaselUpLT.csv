text," Temperature quickly responds to changes in atmospheric CO2 level.  Since CO2 stayed more or less constant over this time scale, so did temperature.","The increase in buried carbon release raises one of atmospheric carbon's sources  Carbon sources are now higher than carbon sinks causing an increase in atmospheric CO2.  However, it will take longer than 200 years for a significant change in CO2 to occur.","Volcanoes, mountain level, and insolation stay the same throughout this scenario.",,"Because temperature remained nearly constant, so did ice level and sea level.",,,"Weathering rate responds to temperature increase.  Since temperature stayed pretty constant over the short 200 year time scale, so did weathering.  Constant weathering will also produce constant carbonate deposition and burial of organic carbon.",,,This scenario shows the effects of a long term increase in buried carbon release due to weathering.  It shows the C release rate increase to medium to show that the effect has started.,

Because CO2 dropped, so did temperature.","During this time period, carbon sinks (burial and carbonate deposition) exceeded carbon sources.  Atmospheric carbon began to decline.  They decline until weathering becomes lower, dropping both organic carbon burial and carbonate deposition.

","Because temperature dropped and ice level rise,  sea level dropped.",,"Because temperature dropped, the planet experiences less rain, decreasing the weathering rate.","Lower weathering rate washes less Ca and C to sea, decreasing carbonate deposition rate, decreasing the C sinks.
